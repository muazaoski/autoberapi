## Quick Start

### 1. Development Mode

```

```

## Using the App

2. **Enter your credentials**:
   - TikTok Username
   - TikTok Password
   - Target Username (who you're messaging)
   - Message (optional, defaults to a streak message)
3. **Configure headless mode** - Check/uncheck based on preference
4. **Save Config** - Saves your settings locally

## Security

- All credentials are stored locally in a `.env` file
- No data is sent to external servers
- The app only communicates with TikTok directly
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control

## Publishing

### GitHub Release

1. Build the executables for your target platforms
2. Create a new release on GitHub
3. Upload the built files from the `dist/` folder
4. Add release notes and version information

### Distribution Notes

- Users don't need Node.js installed
- Puppeteer and Chromium are bundled with the app
- First run may take a moment as dependencies initialize
- The .exe file is standalone and portable

## Customization

### Custom Icon

Replace `icon.png` (and create `icon.ico` for Windows) with your own:
- Windows: 256x256 .ico file
- macOS: 1024x1024 .icns file
- Linux: 512x512 .png file

### UI Theming

Edit `renderer/styles.css` to customize:
- Colors (CSS variables in `:root`)
- Typography
- Layout and spacing
- Animations

### Features

Add new features by:
1. Updating `renderer/index.html` for UI
2. Adding handlers in `renderer/renderer.js`
3. Creating IPC handlers in `main.js`

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Make sure Node.js is installed (for development)
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Check console for error messages

### Build fails
- Ensure electron-builder is installed
- Check that all paths in package.json are correct
- For Windows builds, you may need Visual Studio Build Tools

### Bot fails to run
- Check your TikTok credentials
- Try running with headless mode OFF to see what's happening
- TikTok may require CAPTCHA verification
- Check the console output for specific errors
